You may:  
- Use this catalog for **personal, educational, or community purposes**.  
- Integrate it into **non-profit activities**, provided you follow the redistribution principles.

- Use this catalog for **private commercial gain** without a franchise agreement.  
- **Exceed fair compensation** limits in organizations using this license (see below).  
- Hoard or accumulate profits without redistribution.  

---

## 4. Principles  

### Take Only What You Need  
- Income derived from this catalog should provide a **comfortable and nourishing life**, not unchecked accumulation.  
- ‚ÄúLuxury‚Äù is defined not by excess material goods but by what nourishes **body, mind, and soul**.  

### Fair Compensation  
- Employee compensation may not exceed **‚Ç¨14,000/month (or local equivalent)**.  
- This cap is not meant to impose austerity, but to ensure balance and prevent extractive practices.  

### Redistribution  
- Non-profits may retain up to **13% of leftover profit** after covering expenses.  
- The remaining **87%** must be transferred to the **Fountain of Love steward organization** for redistribution to aligned initiatives.  
- For-profit organizations must negotiate a **franchise license**, contributing back under the same spirit.  

---

## 5. Transparency  
- All users must act in **good faith** and be transparent about their use of the catalog.  
- Reports on redistribution and compensation practices should be available to the steward organization upon request.  

---

## 6. Example  
A non-profit runs workshops using this catalog:  
- They earn ‚Ç¨250,000 in a year.  
- After paying salaries (within the fair compensation cap) and costs, they have ‚Ç¨100,000 surplus.  
- They keep **‚Ç¨13,000 (13%)** for reserves.  
- They transfer **‚Ç¨87,000** back to the Fountain of Love steward organization for redistribution.  

---

## 7. Archetypical Narrative üå±  
This license works like a **fountain**:  

- Water (value, creativity, resources) flows outward to nourish many gardens.  
- Each garden takes what it needs to flourish.  
- Surplus water flows back to the fountain, ensuring it can keep flowing for all.  

The guiding archetype is the **Steward**, not the Owner. The Steward cares for balance, ensuring that all have enough and that abundance circulates.  

---

## 8. Enforcement & Spirit  
- This license is enforceable under the principles stated above.  
- But beyond rules, it relies on **conscious participation**: choosing sufficiency, stewardship, and generosity.  
- If in doubt, ask: *‚ÄúAm I taking only what I truly need, and returning the rest to the flow?‚Äù*
