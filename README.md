# 🌍 Fountain of Love — Operating Model

### *A civilization where love becomes the organizing intelligence.*

Welcome to the **Operating Model** of the Fountain of Love —
the structural, philosophical, and relational blueprint for a civilization
where love shapes everything,
and no one has to walk alone.

This repository gathers the **core documents** that define:

* why we exist (**Purpose**)
* why we act now (**Mission**)
* the world we are building (**Vision**)
* how that world functions (**Operating Principles**)

Together they form a coherent, fractal model for societal, relational, and technological transformation.

## 🌗 Why This Exists

We live in a time of acceleration:

* AI is entering every corner of daily life
* global conflicts reshape our sense of stability
* political extremism grows
* economic uncertainty increases
* people feel disconnected, overwhelmed, and emotionally under-resourced

We are becoming more technologically capable than ever —
and more relationally fragile.

The Fountain of Love exists because the world needs:

* **more authenticity, not more distortion**
* **more love, not more speed**
* **more connection, not more control**
* **more safety, not more separation**

This repository describes how we build that world.
