## Articles

### Article 1 – Purpose and Scope
**Principle:** Every agreement begins with clarity of purpose.  
**Clause:** This Agreement sets out the terms and conditions under which the Parties agree to exchange and protect Confidential Information in the context of their collaboration. The scope of this Agreement is limited to the project described in Annex 01.

### Article 2 – Confidentiality Obligations
**Principle:** Trust requires balancing openness and protection.  
**Clause:** Each Party shall treat as confidential all information disclosed under this Agreement and shall not disclose such information to third parties without prior written consent of the disclosing Party, except where disclosure is strictly necessary for the project. Each Party shall use Confidential Information solely for the project described in Annex 01.

### Article 3 – Definitions and Exclusions
**Principle:** Confidentiality requires clear boundaries.  
**Clause:** Confidential Information means all information designated as confidential in writing or confirmed in writing within thirty (30) days of oral disclosure. Confidential Information does not include:  
a) information publicly available without breach;  
b) lawfully possessed before disclosure;  
c) lawfully obtained from a third party without confidentiality duty;  
d) independently developed without use of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

### Article 4 – Warranties
**Principle:** Care requires lawful and fair dealing.  
**Clause:** Each Party warrants that, to the best of its knowledge, the information disclosed does not infringe the rights of third parties and is lawfully held. No Party makes any warranty as to accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information.

### Article 5 – Ownership of Information
**Principle:** Ownership remains with the originator, contributions are recognised.  
**Clause:** All Confidential Information remains the property of the disclosing Party. Contributions or derivative works created by the receiving Party are transparently logged in Annex 02 and allocated as provided in Annex 03.

### Article 6 – Governing Law and Jurisdiction
**Principle:** Every agreement sits within a legal ecosystem.  
**Clause:** This Agreement is governed by Belgian law. Disputes are first submitted to mediation; if unresolved, they are brought before the courts of Ghent, unless Annex 03 specifies an alternative forum.

### Article 7 – Contributions and Improvements
**Principle:** Contributions must be recognised and fairly allocated.  
**Clause:** Improvements, feedback, or contributions made by the receiving Party are logged in Annex 02. Rights are allocated in accordance with Annex 03, which may provide for joint ownership, licensing, or acknowledgement.

### Article 8 – Duration of Obligations
**Principle:** Time defines obligations.  
**Clause:** This Agreement enters into force upon signature. Confidentiality obligations remain effective during the project and for three (3) years thereafter, except for trade secrets (Annex 01/03) which remain protected while secret.

### Article 9 – Identification of Confidential Information
**Principle:** Clear signals prevent disputes.  
**Clause:** Confidential Information must be marked as 'confidential' or confirmed in writing within thirty (30) days of disclosure. Information not so designated shall not be covered.

### Article 10 – Permitted Use
**Principle:** Information must only flow where necessary.  
**Clause:** Confidential Information shall be used exclusively for the project described in Annex 01. Any other use requires prior written consent of the disclosing Party.

### Article 11 – Remedies for Breach
**Principle:** Justice restores balance when rules are broken.  
**Clause:** If a Party breaches this Agreement, the injured Party is entitled to injunctive relief and direct damages. Liability for indirect damages is excluded unless caused by wilful misconduct or gross negligence.

### Article 12 – Recognition and Culture of Collaboration
**Principle:** Agreements should build respect and long-term trust.  
**Clause:** Parties acknowledge that confidentiality and recognition foster collaboration. Contributions logged in Annex 02 may serve as evidence and recognition in future agreements.

### Article 13 – Reciprocity and Future Collaboration
**Principle:** Sustainable cooperation rests on reciprocity.  
**Clause:** Protections and obligations apply equally to both Parties. This Agreement does not prevent negotiation of future collaboration, franchising, or joint ventures. Annex 04 may outline possible pathways.
